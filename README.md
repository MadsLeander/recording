Recording Clips is a small standalone resource allowing players to record clips and use action replay while playing. 

The default keybindings are as follows:
F1: *Start/Save a recording*
F2: *Toggle Action Replay*
F3: *Cancel current recording*
These can all be changed in the config file or by the individual players in Settings>Key Bindings>Fivem.

The rockstar editor can be accessed by doing /rockstareditor or by going into the pause menu.

The script runs at 0.0ms when idling. 0.02ms when displaying a tooltip.
